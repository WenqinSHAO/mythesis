abstract = {One of the key challenges in changepoint analysis is the ability to detect multiple changes within a given time series or sequence. The changepoint package has been developed to provide users with a choice of multiple changepoint search methods to use in conjunction with a given changepoint method and in particular provides an implementation of the recently proposed PELT algorithm. This article describes the search methods which are implemented in the package as well as some of the available test statistics whilst highlighting their application with simulated and practical examples. segmentation, break points, search methods},

abstract = {We consider the problem of detecting multiple changepoints in large data sets. Our focus is on applications where the number of changepoints will increase as we collect more data: for example in genetics as we sequence larger regions of the genome, or in finance as we observe time-series over longer periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimising a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes most common procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalised likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints, that has a computational cost which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favourably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic, or even cubic. In simulation studies we show that our new method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative methods. We also compare with Binary Segmentation and a genetic algorithm for finding changepoints, and show that the exactness of our approach can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the data.},

@article{Lavin2016,
abstract = {Much of the world's data is streaming, time-series data, where anomalies give significant information in critical situations; examples abound in domains such as finance, IT, security, medical, and energy. Yet detecting anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in real-time, not batches, and learn while simultaneously making predictions. There are no benchmarks to adequately test and score the efficacy of real-time anomaly detectors. Here we propose the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), which attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. The perfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as possible, trigger no false alarms, work with real-world time-series data across a variety of domains, and automatically adapt to changing statistics. Rewarding these characteristics is formalized in NAB, using a scoring algorithm designed for streaming data. NAB evaluates detectors on a benchmark dataset with labeled, real-world time-series data. We present these components, and give results and analyses for several open source, commercially-used algorithms. The goal for NAB is to provide a standard, open source framework with which the research community can compare and evaluate different algorithms for detecting anomalies in streaming data.},

@article{Haynes2016,
abstract = {In this paper we build on an approach proposed by Zou et al. (2014) for nonpara- metric changepoint detection. This approach defines the best segmentation for a data set as the one which minimises a penalised cost function, with the cost function defined in term of minus a non-parametric log-likelihood for data within each segment. Min- imising this cost function is possible using dynamic programming, but their algorithm had a computational cost that is cubic in the length of the data set. To speed up computation, Zou et al. (2014) resorted to a screening procedure which means that the estimated segmentation is no longer guaranteed to be the global minimum of the cost function. We show that the screening procedure adversely affects the accuracy of the changepoint detection method, and show how a faster dynamic programming algorithm, Pruned Exact Linear Time, PELT (Killick et al., 2012), can be used to find the optimal segmentation with a computational cost that can be close to linear in the amount of data. PELT requires a penalty to avoid under/over-fitting the model which can have a detrimental effect on the quality of the detected changepoints. To overcome this issue we use a relatively new method, Changepoints Over a Range of PenaltieS (CROPS) (Haynes et al., 2015), which finds all of the optimal segmentations for multiple penalty values over a continuous range. We apply our method to detect changes in heart rate during physical activity.},

@article{Nomikos2016,
abstract = {Internet eXchange Points (IXP) are critical components of the Internet infrastructure that affect its performance, evolution, secu- rity and economics. In this work, we introduce techniques to augment the well-known traceroute tool with the capability of identifying if and where exactly IXPs are crossed in end-to-end paths. Knowing this information can help end-users have more transparency over how their traffic flows in the Internet. Our tool, called traIXroute, exploits data from the PeeringDB (PDB) and the Packet Clearing House (PCH) about IXP IP addresses of BGP routers, IXP members, and IXP prefixes. We show that the used data are both rich, i.e., we find 12,716 IP addresses of BGP routers in 460 IXPs, and mostly accurate, i.e., our validation shows 92–93{\%} accuracy. In addition, 78.2{\%} of the detected IXPs in our data are based on multiple diverse evidence and therefore help have higher confidence on the detected IXPs than when relying solely on IXP prefixes. To demonstrate the utility of our tool, we use it to show that one out of five paths in our data cross an IXP and that paths do not normally cross more than a single IXP, as it is expected based on the valley-free model about Internet policies. Furthermore, although the top IXPs both in terms of paths and members are located in Europe, US IXPs attract many more paths than their number of members indicates.},

We propose a set of complementary methods to detect network disruptions from traceroute measurements. A novel method of detecting changes in delays is used to identify congested links, and a packet forwarding model is employed to predict traffic paths and to identify faulty routers in case of packet loss. In addition, aggregating results from each method allows us to easily monitor a network and identify coordinated reports manifesting significant network disruptions, reducing uninteresting alarms. Our contributions consist of a statistical approach providing robust estimation for Internet delays and the study of hundreds of thousands link delays. We present three cases demonstrating that the proposed methods detect real disruptions and provide valuable insights, as well as surprising findings, on the location and impact of identified events.},

However, load-balancing capabilities, which create multiple active paths between two end-hosts, are available in most contemporary routers. This paper extends Paris traceroute and proposes an extensive characterization of multipath routing in the Internet. We use Paris traceroute from RON and PlanetLab nodes to collect various datasets in 2007 and 2009. Our results show that the traditional concept of a single network path between hosts no longer holds. For instance, 39{\%} of the source{\&}{\#}x2013;destination pairs in our 2007 traces traverse a load balancer. This fraction increases to 72{\%} if we consider the paths between a source and a destination network. In 2009, we notice a consolidation of per-flow and per-destination techniques and confirm that per-packet load balancing is rare.},

abstract = {Multihoming is increasingly being employed by large enterprises and data centers to extract good performance and reliability from their ISP connections. Multihomed end networks today can employ a variety of route control products to optimize their Internet access performance and reliability. However, little is known about the tangible benefits that such products can offer, the mechanisms they employ and their trade-offs. This paper makes two important contributions. First, we present a study of the potential improvements in Internet round-trip times (RTTs) and transfer speeds from employing multihoming route control. Our analysis shows that multihoming to three or more ISPs and cleverly scheduling traffic across the ISPs can improve Internet RTTs and throughputs by up to 25\% and 20\%, respectively. However, a careful selection of ISPs is important to realize the performance improvements. Second, focusing on large enterprises, we propose and evaluate a wide-range of route control mechanisms and evaluate their design trade-offs. We implement the proposed schemes on a Linux-based Web proxy and perform a trace-based evaluation of their performance. We show that both passive and active measurement-based techniques are equally effective and could improve the Web response times of enterprise networks by up to 25\% on average, compared to using a single ISP. We also outline several "best common practices" for the design of route control products.},

On the other hand, inter-domain traffic engineering becomes indispensable for IP network providers, in order for them to meet their traffic objectives. Unfortunately, this ability of both parties to choose their own routing policies does not necessary lead to the best routing in the Internet. A major challenge of the research on traffic engineering and Internet routing architectures is to accommodate this tussle. However, little is known about the interactions between Inter-domain smart routing and traffic engineering. In this paper, we analyse such interactions through intuitive descriptions and a simulation model. In our evaluations, we observed that the overall stability can benefit from combining Inter-domain adaptive smart routing and traffic engineering. However, we also observed that the effectiveness of Inter-domain traffic engineering can be negatively affected by interdomain routing changes performed by smart routing.},

abstract = {Inter-domain Traffic Engineering for multi-homed networks faces a scalability challenge, as the size of BGP routing table continue to grow. In this context, the choice of the best path must be made potentially for each destination prefix, requiring all available paths to be characterised (e.g., through measurements) and compared with each other. Fortunately, it is well-known that a few number of prefixes carry the larger part of the traffic. As a natural consequence, to engineer large volume of traffic only few prefixes need to be managed. Yet, traffic characteristics of a given prefix can greatly vary over time, and little is known on the dynamism of traffic at this aggregation level, including predicting the set of the most significant prefixes in the near future. {\%}based on past observations. Sophisticated prediction methods won't scale in such context. In this paper, we study the relationship between prefix volume, stability, and predictability, based on recent traffic traces from nine different networks. Three simple and resource-efficient methods to select the prefixes associated with the most important foreseeable traffic volume are then proposed. Such proposed methods allow to select sets of prefixes with both excellent representativeness (volume coverage) and stability in time, for which the best routes are identified. The analysis carried out confirm the potential benefits of a route decision engine.},

Several databases are available and are frequently used by many services and web sites in the Internet. Contrary to widespread belief, geolocation databases are far from being as reliable as they claim. In this paper, we conduct a comparison of several current geolocation databases -both commercial and free- to have an insight of the limitations in their usability. First, the vast majority of entries in the databases refer only to a few popular countries (e.g., U.S.). This creates an imbalance in the representation of countries across the IP blocks of the databases. Second, these entries do not reflect the original allocation of IP blocks, nor BGP announcements. In addition, we quantify the accuracy of geolocation databases on a large European ISP based on ground truth information. This is the first study using a ground truth showing that the overly fine granularity of database entries makes their accuracy worse, not better. Geolocation databases can claim country-level accuracy, but certainly not city-level.},

One essential component of these tasks is the ability to predict routes in the Internet. However, the Internet is composed of a large number of independent autonomous systems (ASes) resulting in complex interactions, and until now no model of the Internet has succeeded in producing predictions of acceptable accuracy.We demonstrate that there are two limitations of prior models: (i) they have all assumed that an Autonomous System (AS) is an atomic structure - it is not, and (ii) models have tended to oversimplify the relationships between ASes. Our approach uses multiple quasi-routers to capture route diversity within the ASes, and is deliberately agnostic regarding the types of relationships between ASes. The resulting model ensures that its routing is consistent with the observed routes. Exploiting a large number of observation points, we show that our model provides accurate predictions for unobserved routes, a first step towards developing structural mod-els of the Internet that enable real applications.},

abstract = {Robust measurements of network dynamics are increasingly important to the design and operation of large internetworks like the Internet. However, administrative diversity makes it impractical to monitor every link on an end-to-end path. At the same time, it is difficult to determine the performance characteristics of individual links from end-to-end measurements of unicast traffic. In this paper, we introduce the use of end-to-end measurements of multicast traffic to infer network-internal characteristics. The bandwidth efficiency of multicast traffic makes it suitable for large-scale measurements of both end-to-end and internal network dynamics. We develop a maximum-likelihood estimator for loss rates on internal links based on losses observed by multicast receivers. It exploits the inherent correlation between such observations to infer the performance of paths between branch points in the tree spanning a multicast source and its receivers. We derive its rate of convergence as the number of measurements increases, and we establish robustness with respect to certain generalizations of the underlying model. We validate these techniques through simulation and discuss possible extensions and applications of this work.},

Recent research in network tomography has demonstrated that it is possible to estimate internal link characteristics, e.g., link delays and packet losses, using unicast probing schemes in which probes are exchanged between several pairs of sites in the network. We present a new method for estimation of internal link delay distributions using the end-to-end packet pair delay statistics gathered by back-to-back packet-pair unicast probes. Our method is based on a variant of the penalized maximum likelihood expectation-maximization (PML-EM) algorithm applied to an additive finite mixture model for the link delay probability density functions. The mixture model incorporates a combination of discrete and continuous components, and we use a minimum message length (MML) penalty for selection of model order. We present results of Matlab and ns-2 simulations to illustrate the promise of our network tomography algorithm for light cross-traffic scenarios.},

@article{Liang2003,
abstract = { Network monitoring and diagnosis are key to improving network performance. The difficulties of performance monitoring lie in today's fast growing Internet, accompanied by increasingly heterogeneous and unregulated structures. Moreover, these tasks become even harder since one cannot rely on the collaboration of individual routers and servers to measure network traffic directly. Even though the aggregative nature of possible network measurements gives rise to inverse problems, existing methods for solving inverse problems are usually computationally intractable or statistically inefficient. A pseudo likelihood approach is proposed to solve a group of network tomography problems. The basic idea of pseudo likelihood is to form simple subproblems and ignore the dependences among the subproblems to form a product likelihood of the subproblems. As a result, this approach keeps a good balance between the computational complexity and the statistical efficiency of the parameter estimation. Some statistical properties of the pseudo likelihood estimator, such as consistency and asymptotic normality, are established. A pseudo expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed to maximize the pseudo log-likelihood function. Two examples, with simulated or real data, are used to illustrate the pseudo likelihood proposal: 1) inference of the internal link delay distributions through multicast end-to-end measurements; 2) origin-destination matrix estimation through link traffic counts.},

@article{Coates2002,
abstract = {Today's Internet is a massive, distributed network which continues to explode in size as e-commerce and related activities grow. The heterogeneous and largely unregulated structure of the Internet renders tasks such as dynamic routing, optimized service provision, service-level verification, and detection of anomalous/malicious behavior increasingly challenging tasks. The problem is compounded by the fact that one cannot rely on the cooperation of individual servers and routers to aid in the collection of network traffic measurements vital for these tasks. In many ways, network monitoring and inference problems bear a strong resemblance to other "inverse problems" in which key aspects of a system are not directly observable. Familiar signal processing problems such as tomographic image reconstruction, system identification, and array processing all have interesting interpretations in the networking context. This article introduces the new field of network tomography, a field which we believe will benefit greatly from the wealth of signal processing theory and algorithms.},

In this paper we concentrate on the estimation and localization of internal delays based on end-to-end delay measurements from a source to receivers.

abstract = {Since the beginning of the nineties, the internet has undergone impressive growth. This growth can be appreciated in terms of the equipment, such as routers and links, that has been added, as well as in the numbers of users and the value of commerce that it supports. In parallel to this expansion, over the past decade the networking research community has shown a growing interest in discovering and analyzing the internet topology. Some researchers have developed tools for gathering network topology data while others have tried to understand and model the internet??s properties. These efforts have brought us to a crucial juncture for toplogy measurement infrastructures: while, previously, these were both small (in terms of number of measurement points) and monolithic, we are starting to see the deployment of large-scale distributed systems composed of hundreds or thousands of monitors. As we look forward to this next generation of systems, we take stock of what has been achieved so far. In this survey, we discuss past and current mechanisms for discovering the internet topology at various levels: the IP interface, the router, the AS, and the PoP level. In addition to discovery techniques, we provide insights into some of the wellknown properties of the internet topology.},

abstract = {Internet eXchange Points (IXP) are critical components of the Internet infrastructure that affect its performance, evolution, secu- rity and economics. In this work, we introduce techniques to augment the well-known traceroute tool with the capability of identifying if and where exactly IXPs are crossed in end-to-end paths. Knowing this information can help end-users have more transparency over how their traffic flows in the Internet. Our tool, called traIXroute, exploits data from the PeeringDB (PDB) and the Packet Clearing House (PCH) about IXP IP addresses of BGP routers, IXP members, and IXP prefixes. We show that the used data are both rich, i.e., we find 12,716 IP addresses of BGP routers in 460 IXPs, and mostly accurate, i.e., our validation shows 92–93{\%} accuracy. In addition, 78.2{\%} of the detected IXPs in our data are based on multiple diverse evidence and therefore help have higher confidence on the detected IXPs than when relying solely on IXP prefixes. To demonstrate the utility of our tool, we use it to show that one out of five paths in our data cross an IXP and that paths do not normally cross more than a single IXP, as it is expected based on the valley-free model about Internet policies. Furthermore, although the top IXPs both in terms of paths and members are located in Europe, US IXPs attract many more paths than their number of members indicates.},

Several experiments were devised by considering real-world data from two large Internet Service Providers. In addition, different time scales (e.g. every five minutes and hourly) and forecasting horizons were analyzed. Overall, the NNE approach is competitive when compared with other TSF methods (e.g. Holt-Winters and ARIMA).},

The traces display a highly nonuniform distribution of traffic on flows between pairs of hosts, networks, and ASes. Aggregation along coarser granularities, such as networks or ASes, accentuates this nonuniform distribution. In one typical trace, for example, the top 9\% of flows between ASes accounts for 86.7\% of the packets and 90.7\% of the bytes transmitted. A highly nonuniform traffic pattern suggests that routers need to maintain only limited QoS flow state. The paper discusses the implications of this phenomenon on different proposed QoS mechanisms},

On the other hand, inter-domain traffic engineering becomes indispensable for IP network providers, in order for them to meet their traffic objectives. Unfortunately, this ability of both parties to choose their own routing policies does not necessary lead to the best routing in the Internet. A major challenge of the research on traffic engineering and Internet routing architectures is to accommodate this tussle. However, little is known about the interactions between Inter-domain smart routing and traffic engineering. In this paper, we analyse such interactions through intuitive descriptions and a simulation model. In our evaluations, we observed that the overall stability can benefit from combining Inter-domain adaptive smart routing and traffic engineering. However, we also observed that the effectiveness of Inter-domain traffic engineering can be negatively affected by interdomain routing changes performed by smart routing.},

We explore the end-to-end delay and loss characteristics of different paths and find that substantial improvements can potentially be achieved by path switching, especially in lowering end-to-end losses. Based on this assessment, we develop a simple path-switching mechanism capable of realizing those performance improvements. Our experimental study demonstrates that substantial performance improvements are indeed achievable using this approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of how to represent the locations of Internet hosts in a Cartesian coordinate system to facilitate estimation of network distances among arbitrary Internet hosts. We envision an infrastructure that consists of beacon nodes and provides the service of estimating network distance between pairs of hosts without direct delay measurement. We show that the principal component analysis (PCA) technique can effectively extract topological information from delay measurements between beacon hosts. Based on PCA, we devise a transformation method that projects the raw distance space into a new coordinate system of (much) smaller dimensions. The transformation retains as much topological information as possible and yet enables end hosts to determine their coordinates in the coordinate system. The resulting new coordinate system is termed as the Internet Coordinate System (ICS). As compared to existing work (e.g., IDMaps and GNP), ICS incurs smaller computation overhead in calculating the coordinates of hosts and smaller measurement overhead (required for end hosts to measure their distances to beacon hosts). Finally, we show via experiments with both real-life and synthetic data sets that ICS makes robust and accurate estimates of network distances, incurs little computational overhead, and its performance is not susceptible to the number of beacon nodes (as long as it exceeds a certain threshold) and the network topology.},

abstract = {Very recent activities in the IETF and in the Routing Research Group (RRG) of the IRTG focus on defining a new Internet architecture, in order to solve scalability issues related to interdo-main routing. The approach that is being explored is based on the separation of the end-systems' addressing space (the identifiers) and the routing locators' space. This separation is meant to alleviate the routing burden of the Default Free Zone, but it implies the need of distributing and storing mappings between identifiers and locators on caches placed on routers. In this paper we evaluate the cost of maintaining these caches when the distribution mechanism is based on a pull model. Taking as a reference the LISP protocol, we base our evaluation on real Netflow traces collected on the border router of our campus network. We thoroughly analyze the impact of the locator/ID separation, and related cost, showing that there is a trade-off between the dynamism of the mapping distribution protocol, the demand in terms of bandwidth, and the size of the caches.},

abstract = {Although the use of software-defined networking (SDN) enables routes of packets to be controlled with finer granularity (down to the individual flow level) by using traffic engineering (TE) and thereby enables better balancing of the link loads, the corresponding increase in the number of states that need to be managed at routers and controller is problematic in large-scale networks. Aggregating flows into macro flows and assigning routes by macro flow should be an effective approach to solving this problem. However, when macro flows are constructed as TE targets, variations of traffic rates in each macro flow should be minimized to improve route stability. We propose two methods for generating macro flows: one is based on a greedy algorithm that minimizes the variation in rates, and the other clusters micro flows with similar traffic variation patterns into groups and optimizes the traffic ratio of extracted from each cluster to aggregate into each macro flow. Evaluation using traffic demand matrixes for 48 hours of Internet2 traffic demonstrated that the proposed methods can reduce the number of TE targets to about 1/50 \~{} 1/400 without degrading the link-load balancing effect of TE.},

abstract = {Internet routers' forwarding tables (FIBs), which must be stored in expensive fast memory for high-speed packet forwarding, are growing quickly in size due to increased multihoming, finer-grained traffic engineering, and deployment of IPv6 and VPNs. To address this problem, several Internet architectures have been proposed to reduce FIB size by returning to the earlier approach of route caching : storing only the working set of popular routes in the FIB. This paper revisits route caching. We build upon previous work by studying flat, uni-class (/24) prefix caching, with modern traffic traces from more than 60 routers in a tier-1 ISP. We first characterize routers' working sets and then evaluate route-caching performance under different cache replacement strategies and cache sizes. Surprisingly, despite the large number of deaggregated /24 subnets, caching uni-class prefixes can effectively curb the increase of FIB sizes. Moreover, uni-class prefixes substantially simplify a cache design by eliminating longest-prefix matching, enabling FIB design with slower memory technologies. Finally, by comparing our results with previous work, we show that the distribution of traffic across prefixes is becoming increasingly skewed, making route caching more appealing.},

abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change the state of affairs of current networks, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. Today, SDN is both a hot research topic and a concept gaining wide acceptance in industry, which justifies the comprehensive survey presented in this paper. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbounds APIs, network virtualization layers, network operating systems, network programming languages, and management applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular, we address the design of switches and control platforms -- with a focus on aspects such as resiliency, scalability, performance, security and dependability -- as well as new opportunities for carrier transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.},

abstract = {Distance estimation and topological proximity in the Internet have recently emerged as important problems for many distributed applications [1], [10], [11], [19], [29], [31], [40], [41], [44]. Besides deploying tracers and using virtual coordinates, distance is often estimated using end-to-end methods such as King [13] that rely on the existing DNS infrastructure. However, the question of accuracy in such end-to-end estimation and its ability to produce a large-scale map of Internet delays has never been examined. We undertake this task below and show that King suffers from non-negligible error when DNS zones employ geographically diverse authoritative servers or utilize forwarders, both of which are very common in the existing Internet. We also show that King requires insertion of numerous unwanted DNS records in caches of remote servers (which is called cache pollution) and requires large traffic overhead when deployed in large-scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework we call Turbo King (T-King) that obtains end-to-end delay samples without bias in the presence of distant authoritative servers and forwarders, while consuming half the bandwidth needed by King and reducing the impact of cache pollution by several orders of magnitude. We finish the paper by evaluating Turbo King in several experiments.},

abstract = {Traffic engineering with traffic prediction is one approach to accommodate time-varying traffic without frequent route changes. In this approach, the routes are calculated so as to avoid congestion based on the predicted traffic. The accuracy of the traffic prediction however has large impacts on this approach. Especially, if the predicted traffic amount is significantly less than the actual traffic, the congestion may occur. In this paper, we propose the traffic prediction methods suitable to the traffic engineering. In our method, we perform preprocessing before the prediction in order to predict the periodical variation accurately. Moreover, we consider the confidence interval for the prediction error and the variation excluded by the preprocessing to avoid the congestion caused by the temporal traffic variation. In this paper, we discuss three preprocessing approaches; the trend component, the lowpass filter, and the envelope. Through simulation, we clarify that the preprocessing by the trend component or the lowpass filter increases the accuracy of the prediction. In addition, considering the confidence interval achieves the lower link utilization within a fixed control period.},

abstract = {We introduce a methodology to predict when and where link additions/upgrades have to take place in an Internet protocol (IP) backbone network. Using simple network management protocol (SNMP) statistics, collected continuously since 1999, we compute aggregate demand between any two adjacent points of presence (PoPs) and look at its evolution at time scales larger than 1 h. We show that IP backbone traffic exhibits visible long term trends, strong periodicities, and variability at multiple time scales. Our methodology relies on the wavelet multiresolution analysis (MRA) and linear time series models. Using wavelet MRA, we smooth the collected measurements until we identify the overall long-term trend. The fluctuations around the obtained trend are further analyzed at multiple time scales. We show that the largest amount of variability in the original signal is due to its fluctuations at the 12-h time scale. We model inter-PoP aggregate demand as a multiple linear regression model, consisting of the two identified components. We show that this model accounts for 98\% of the total energy in the original signal, while explaining 90\% of its variance. Weekly approximations of those components can be accurately modeled with low-order autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. We show that forecasting the long term trend and the fluctuations of the traffic at the 12-h time scale yields accurate estimates for at least 6 months in the future.},

abstract = {Modern Internet routers require powerful forwarding facilities to cope with extremely high rate Forwarding Information Base (FIB) lookups. In general, the FIB is constrained to a small highly efficient but expensive memory. Unfortunately, the BGP route table (RIB) keeps increasing, and this subsequently results in severe FIB inflation at BGP routers. What if we only load a small portion of the RIB into the FIB? Recently the route caching mechanism has been revisited. With such a route caching mechanism, the optimal method is to load in a FIB with popular prefixes which contribute major traffic loads. We propose a prediction based method to catch those popular prefixes with a limited cache size. In this paper, the dynamics of popular prefixes has been studied based on real traffic traces from different ISPs. On applying a GM(1,1) model which is widely applied in grey system control and prediction, we propose a traffic prediction-based route caching method which attempts to bias the cache dump strategy with a range of history to ameliorate the effects of bursts from non-popular prefixes. We also suggest applying FIB aggregation techniques, e.g. Optimal Routing Table Constructor (ORTC) algorithm, to suppress the number of non-popular sub-prefixes of the popular prefixes on route updates. The evaluation of our method is based on simulation over real traffic traces. The simulation shows our prediction-based cache replacement strategy outperforms other cache strategies and matches Internet traffic dynamics very well.},
